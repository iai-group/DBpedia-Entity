The DBpedia-Entity collection has been extended for other entity-oriented tasks. These collections are available for download:


  - [DBpedia-Entity-CAR](https://github.com/TREMA-UNH/DBpediaV2-entity-CAR): DBpedia-entity v2 collection projected onto the Wikipedia dump used in [TREC Complex Answer Retrieval v2.1](http://trec-car.cs.unh.edu/datareleases/), a contribtion from TREMA Lab at University of New Hampshire.
  
  - [Entity summarization](https://github.com/iai-group/DynamicEntitySummarization-DynES) [1]: 100 query-entity pairs (evenly selected from the four query subsets), their corresponding entity facts, and their graded judgments with respect to importance, relevance, and utility.

  - [Target type identification](https://github.com/iai-group/sigir2017-query_types) [2]: DBpedia-entity queries annotated with target query types using the DBpedia ontology.
